# DDD
Objective: Use Difference-in-difference models to estimate the impact of the ACA on insurance coverage rates in the US. This investigation explores whether economists' estimates of the impact of the ACA on insurance coverage are different depending on the use of an initial year dataset (2012-2014) or a full year dataset (2012-2017). 

Developed in 2019 for College Economics Paper

Results: As firms and states acclimate to the ACAâ€™s implementation, the data predicts a likelihood of coverage that is larger for 2012-2017 than for 2012-2014. The simple DD model estimates for years 2012-2017 that the Medicaid expansion increased the probability of having any insurance by 1.6%, compared to 1.4% in 2012-2014. The triple difference model also estimates that the Medicaid expansion increased the probability of any insurance by 1.6% for the full year dataset.
